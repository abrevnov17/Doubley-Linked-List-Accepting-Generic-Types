# Doubley-Linked-List-Accepting-Generic-Types
This was an assignment that I completed for my Advanced Computer Science class my Junior year of highscool. I created a Doubley Linked List class that took generic types and could perform numerous methods such as swap(), add(), remove(), print(), get(), set(), etc...

The final product was very similar to an ArrayList.

All of this assignment was written in Java and was run/tested using Terminal.
